        <p>about</p>
        <p>
          My journey as a developer began as an intern in a development team
          during my final semester, where I gained practical experience through
          intranet maintenance and building automation processes. Later,
          recognizing the importance of UI/UX in frontend development, I worked
          in an agency's design team, developing a comprehensive perspective
          that bridges design and development through more than 20 projects.
          Currently, I'm gaining team project experience at Programmers
          DevCourse, and I've created this{` `}
          <span>simple and intuitive portfolio</span> that encompasses both my
          development and design capabilities. Through minimal design using
          geometric shapes and interactive elements implemented in React, you
          can experience my pursuit of clean code and user-friendly design
          principles.
